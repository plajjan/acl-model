      <t>Access Control List (ACL) is one of the basic elements used to
      configure device forwarding behavior. It is used in many networking
      technologies such as Policy Based Routing, Firewalls etc.</t>

      <t>An ACL is an ordered set of rules that is used to filter traffic on a
      networking device. Each rule is represented by an Access Control Entry
      (ACE).</t>

      <t>Each ACE has a group of match criteria and a group of action
      criteria.</t>

      <t>The match criteria consist of a tuple of packet header match criteria
      and can have metadata match criteria as well.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Packet header matches apply to fields visible in the packet such
          as address or class of service or port numbers.</t>

          <t>In case vendor supports it, metadata matches apply to fields
          associated with the packet but not in the packet header such as
          input interface or overall packet length</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The actions specify what to do with the packet when the matching
      criteria is met. These actions are any operations that would apply to
      the packet, such as counting, policing, or simply forwarding.The list of
      potential actions is endless depending on the capabilities of the
      networked devices.</t>

      <t>Access Control List is also widely knowns as ACL (pronounce as [ak-uh
      l]) or Access List. In this document, Access Control List, ACL and
      Access List are used interchangeably.</t>

      <t>The matching of filters and actions in an ACE/ACL are triggered only
      after application/attachment of the ACL to an interface, VRF, vty/tty
      session, QoS policy, routing protocols amongst various other config
      attachment points. Once attached, it is used for filtering traffic using
      the match criteria in the ACE's and taking appropriate action(s) that
      have been configured against that ACE. In order to apply an ACL to any
      attachment point, vendors would have to augment the ACL YANG model.</t>

    <section anchor="problem" title="Problem Statement">
      <t>This document defines a <xref target="RFC6020">YANG</xref> data model
      for the configuration of ACLs. It is very important that model can be
      easily used by applications/attachments.</t>

      <t>ACL implementations in every device may vary greatly in terms of the
      filter constructs and actions that they support. Therefore this draft
      proposes a model that can be augmented by standard extensions and vendor
      proprietary models.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- problem -->

    <section anchor="design" title="Understanding ACL's Filters and Actions">
      <t>Although different vendors have different ACL data models, there is a
      common understanding of what access control list (ACL) is. A network
      system usually have a list of ACLs, and each ACL contains an ordered
      list of rules, also known as access list entries &ndash; ACEs. Each ACE
      has a group of match criteria and a group of action criteria. The match
      criteria consist of packet header matching. It as also possible for ACE
      to match on metadata, if supported by the vendor. Packet header matching
      applies to fields visible in the packet such as address or class of
      service or port numbers. Metadata matching applies to fields associated
      with the packet, but not in the packet header such as input interface,
      packet length, or source or destination prefix length. The actions can
      be any sort of operation from logging to rate limiting or dropping to
      simply forwarding. Actions on the first matching ACE are applied with no
      processing of subsequent ACEs.</t>

      <t>The model also includes a container to hold overall operational state
      for each ACL and operational state for each ACE. One ACL can be applied
      to multiple targets within the device, such as interfaces of a networked
      device, applications or features running in the device, etc. When
      applied to interfaces of a networked device, the ACL is applied in a
      direction which indicates if it should be applied to packet entering
      (input) or leaving the device (output). An example in the appendix shows
      how to express it in YANG model.</t>

      <t>This draft tries to address the commonalities between all vendors and
      create a common model, which can be augmented with proprietary models.
      The base model is simple and with this design we hope to achieve enough
      flexibility for each vendor to extend the base model. The use of feature
      statements in the document allows vendors to advertise match rules they
      support.</t>

      <section anchor="aclmodules" title="ACL Modules">
        <t>There are two YANG modules in the model. The first module,
        "ietf-access-control-list", defines generic ACL aspects which are
        common to all ACLs regardless of their type or vendor. In effect, the
        module can be viewed as providing a generic ACL "superclass". It
        imports the second module, "ietf-packet-fields". The match container
        in "ietf-access-control-list" uses groupings in "ietf-packet-fields".
        The combination of if-feature checks and must statements allow for the
        selection of relevant match fields that a user can define rules
        for.</t>

        <t>If there is a need to define new "matches" choice, such as <xref
        target="RFC5101">IPFIX</xref>, the container "matches" can be
        augmented.</t>

        <t>For a reference to the annotations used in the diagram below, see
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams">YANG Tree
        Diagrams</xref>.</t>

      <section anchor="ietfacl" title="IETF Access Control List module">
        <t>"ietf-access-control-list" is the standard top level module for
        access lists. The "access-lists" container stores a list of "acl".
        Each "acl" has information identifying the access list by a
        name("acl-name") and a list("access-list-entries") of rules associated
        with the "acl-name". Each of the entries in the
        list("access-list-entries"), indexed by the string "rule-name", has
        containers defining "matches" and "actions".</t>

        <t>The model uses defines several ACL types in the form of identities
        and features. Features are used by implementors to select the ACL
        types the system can support. These types are implicitly inherited by
        the "ace", thus safeguarding against misconfiguration of "ace" types
        in an "acl".</t>

        <t>The "matches" define criteria used to identify patterns in
        "ietf-packet-fields". The "actions" define behavior to undertake once
        a "match" has been identified. In addition to permit and deny for
        actions, a logging option allows for a match to be logged that can be
        used to determine which rule was matched upon. The model also defines
        the ability for ACL's to be attached to a particular interface. </t>

        <t>Statistics in the ACL can be collected for an "ace" or for an
        "interface". The feature statements defined for statistics can be used
        to determine whether statistics are being collected per "ace", per
        "interface" or both.</t>

      <section anchor="pktheaders" title="IETF Packet Fields module">
        <t>The packet fields module defines the necessary groups for matching
        on fields in the packet including ethernet, ipv4, ipv6, and transport
        layer fields. The 'acl-type' node determines which of these fields get
        included for any given ACL with the exception of TCP, UDP and ICMP
        header fields. Those fields can be used in conjunction with any of the
        above layer 2 or layer 3 fields.</t>

        <t>Since the number of match criteria is very large, the base draft
        does not include these directly but references them by "uses" to keep
        the base module simple. In case more match conditions are needed,
        those can be added by augmenting choices within container "matches" in

      <t>Alex Clemm, Andy Bierman and Lisa Huang started it by sketching out
      an initial IETF draft in several past IETF meetings. That draft included
      an ACL YANG model structure and a rich set of match filters, and
      acknowledged contributions by Louis Fourie, Dana Blair, Tula Kraiser,
      Patrick Gili, George Serpa, Martin Bjorklund, Kent Watsen, and Phil
      Shafer. Many people have reviewed the various earlier drafts that made
      the draft went into IETF charter.</t>

      <t>Dean Bogdanovic, Kiran Agrahara Sreenivasa, Lisa Huang, and Dana
      Blair each evaluated the YANG model in previous drafts separately, and
      then worked together to created a ACL draft that was supported by
      different vendors. That draft removed vendor specific features, and gave
      examples to allow vendors to extend in their own proprietary ACL. The
      earlier draft was superseded with this updated draft and received more
      participation from many vendors.</t>

      <t>Authors would like to thank Jason Sterne, Lada Lhotka, Juergen

        <t>Module "example-newco-acl" is an example of company proprietary
        model that augments "ietf-acl" module. It shows how to use 'augment'
        with an XPath expression to add additional match criteria, action
        criteria, and default actions when no ACE matches found. All these are
        company proprietary extensions or system feature extensions.
        "example-newco-acl" is just an example and it is expected from vendors
        to create their own proprietary models.</t>

        <t>The following figure is the tree structure of example-newco-acl. In
        this example,
        /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:matches
        are augmented with two new choices, protocol-payload-choice and
        metadata. The protocol-payload-choice uses a grouping with an
        enumeration of all supported protocol values. Metadata matches apply
        to fields associated with the packet but not in the packet header such
        as overall packet length. In other example,
        /ietf-acl:access-lists/ietf-acl:acl/ietf-acl:aces/ietf-acl:ace/ietf-acl:actions

        ip6tables, arptables, ebtables), so each one had separate data model.
        Recently, this has changed and a single utility, nftables, has been
        developed. With a single application, it has a single data model for
        filewall filters and it follows very similarly to the
        ietf-access-control list module proposed in this draft. The nftables

        <t>We can see that there are many similarities between Linux nftables
        and IETF ACL YANG data models and its extension models. It should be
        fairly easy to do translation between ACL YANG model described in this
        draft and Linux nftables.</t>

        <t>The ACL module is dependent on the definition of ethertypes. IEEE
        owns the allocation of those ethertypes. This model is being included
        here to enable definition of those types till such time that IEEE

        ethertypes. At that time, this model can be deprecated.</t>
